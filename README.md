# covid_data_exploration_using_sql
This project provides insights of covid data. The SQL analysis is implemented on Microsoft SQL Server.
This is an SQL COVID-19 exploration project which focuses on cases, deaths, and vaccinations. I believe more explorations can be done as the purpose of this project was to apply basic knowledge of SQL in exploring a real-life scenario(COVID-19 Outbreak).
